\chapter{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to use generative art techniques to explore the
spaces created by the works of the artist \emph{Darrell Viner (1947-2001)}. Viner's work
included movement, sound, and light, and though primarily working with
sculpture, he produced a series of pen plotter drawings. These drawings have
been called pioneering works in the field of computer art \citep{viner_bio}.
