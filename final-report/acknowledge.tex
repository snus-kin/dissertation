Thanks to John Stell for supervising this project and giving a lot of generally
good advice!

Thanks to Rob Sturman for running `The Mathematics of Music' (MATH2340) in which
some of the ideas used in this report were introduced to me.

And finally, thanks to my friends and family for supporting me through this.
