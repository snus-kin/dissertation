Note that it is not acceptable to solicit assistance on `proof reading' which is
defined as the ``the systematic checking and identification of errors in
spelling, punctuation, grammar and sentence construction, formatting and layout
in the test''; see http://www.leeds.ac.uk/gat/documents/policy/Proof-reading-policy.pdf.
